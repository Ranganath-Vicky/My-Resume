        \normalsize{\item {A retrieval engine was built where all documents are read, stemmed and tokenised using \textbf{Python's NLTK package}.} 
        \item{\textbf{RegEx} were used to achieve a token list containing all matched patterns from the documents.}
        \item{Search ranking technique was implemented to rank all documents based on tf-idf weights, term frequencies and document frequencies.}
        \item{Userâ€™s query terms were spell checked before the retrieval process by obtaining all possible combinations of letters present in the term.}}
